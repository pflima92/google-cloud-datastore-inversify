# Google Cloud Datastore Inversify

Some utilities for the development of Google Cloud Datastore applications using Inversify.

## Installation

You can install `inversify-datastore` using npm:

```sh
npm install inversify inversify-datastore reflect-metadata --save
```

The `inversify-datastore` type definitions are included in the npm module and require TypeScript 2.0.
Please refer to the [InversifyJS documentation](https://github.com/inversify/InversifyJS#installation) to learn more about the installation process.

## The Basics

### Step 1: Decorate your repository

To use a class as a "repository" for your node app, simply add the `@repository` decorator to the class. 

```ts
import { entity, key, repository } from 'datastore-inversify';

@entity('UserKind')
class User {
    @key
    id: string;
    name: string;
}

@repository(User)
class UserRepository<User> {

    findById(id: string): Promise<User|undefined>;
    
    findAll(): Promise<User[]>;

    save(entity: User): Promise<User>;
}
```

### Step 2: Configure container

Configure the inversify container in your composition root as usual.

```ts
import { Container } from 'inversify';

// declare metadata by @controller annotation
import "./repositories/user_repository";

// set up container
let container = new Container();

// set up bindings
container.bind<FooService>('FooService').to(FooService);

@injectable()
class FooService {

    repository: UserRepository;

    constructor(@inject(UserRepository) repository: UserRepository){
        this.repository = repository;
    }
}

```
